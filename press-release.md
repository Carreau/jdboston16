_Cambridge, MA_.  A dynamic group of data scientists, software developers, and educators is converging on March 17 and 18 in Cambridge, MA to present at the third [Jupyter Day](http://blog.jupyter.org/2016/02/16/jupyterdays-boston-2016/). Sponsored by the [Jupyter Project](http://jupyter.org/), the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/), the [Harvard Law School Library](http://hls.harvard.edu/library/), and [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/), the event is the place to learn about state of the art data analysis tools from the people who know them best.  Please see the [conference page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jupyterdays-boston-2016-tickets-21440120979) for details and registration.

The first day explores Jupyter's many applications, with a particular focus on education, the sciences, and data visualization.  Speakers on the first day include:

* Mattias Bussonnier, one of the core Jupyter developers, discusses where the project has been and where it's headed.
* Chelsea Douglas from [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) discusses the many great new features for creating beautiful data visualizations.
* Jeremy Freeman, a neuroscientist at the [Howard Hughes Medical Center](https://www.hhmi.org/), shows [binder](http://mybinder.org/), his popular service for launching Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.
* Elaine Angelino from the [Berkeley Institute Data Science (BIDS)](http://bids.berkeley.edu/) lays out an ambitious new Jupyter-based data science curriculum being rolled out across UC Berkeley.

The second day is your chance to get your hands dirty and learn from the experts how to make the most of Jupyter:

* Laurent Gautier from [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) explores how to take advantage of the many, many languages and tools Jupyter supports.  It's not just for Python anymore!
* Kyle Kelley and Ash Wilson from [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/) demonstrate how to set up JupyterHub, the multiuser platform for Jupyter, on [Carina](https://getcarina.com/), Rackspace's free hosting service for Docker.

The day will also cover many of the technologies you need to make the most of the Jupyter:

* Jonas Rosland from [EMC \{Code\}]((http://emccode.github.io/) reprises his popular "Introduction to Docker" tutorial.  (Why Docker, you ask?  It's the basis for a large and growing infrastructure around scaling the notebook services, so it's an essential part of the Jupyter ecosystem.  Plus, it's awesome.)
* Daina Bouquin from the [Harvard Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) provides an introduction to Git and GitHub.  This is *the* essential tool for collaboration in modern Open Source software projects.

In addition to formal talks, there will be time allotted for audience driven "Birds of a Feather" sessions so that attendees can learn from each other about Jupyter is being used in their fields.
