# Program Announcement for JupyterDays Boston

_Cambridge, MA_.  The [Jupyter Project](http://jupyter.org/), [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/), and  [O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/) are pleased to announce the program for the third [Jupyter Day](http://blog.jupyter.org/2016/02/16/jupyterdays-boston-2016/) series, which will be held at Harvard Law School on March 17-18.  Please see the [conference page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/jupyterdays-boston-2016-tickets-21440120979) for details and registration information.

The first day covers Jupyter's applications, with a particular focus on its uses in education, the sciences, and data visualization.  Sessions on the first day include:

* Mattias Bussonnier, one of the core Jupyter developers, covers where the project has been and where it's headed next
* Chelsea Douglas from [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) discusses the many great new features for creating beautiful data visualizations
* Jeremy Freeman, a neuroscientist at the [Howard Hughes Medical Center](https://www.hhmi.org/), shows [binder](http://mybinder.org/), his popular service for launching Jupyter notebooks in the cloud
* Elaine Angelino from the [Berkeley Institute Data Science (BIDS)](http://bids.berkeley.edu/) lays out an ambitious new Jupyter-based data science curriculum being rolled out across UC Berkeley

The second day is your chance to get your hands dirty and learn from the experts how to make the most of Jupyter:

* Laurent Gautier from [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/) explores how to take advantage of the many, many languages and tools Jupyter supports.  It's not just for Python anymore!
* Kyle Kelley and Ash Wilson from [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/) demonstrate how to set up JupyterHub, the multiuser platform for Jupyter, on [Carina](https://getcarina.com/), Rackspace's free hosting service for Docker.

We'll also offer session on the technologies you need to make the most of the Jupyter:

* Jonas Rosland from [EMC {code}]((http://emccode.github.io/) reprises his popular "Introduction to Docker" tutorial.  (Why Docker, you ask?  It's the basis for a large and growing infrastructure around scaling the notebook services, so it's an essential part of the Jupyter ecosystem.  Plus, it's awesome.)
* Daina Bouquin from the [Harvard Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) provides and introduction to Git and GitHub.  This is *the* essential tool for collaboration in modern Open Source software projects.

But wait, there's more!  ;)  

We've carved out plenty of time for audience driven "Birds of a Feather" sessions so that you'll have time to meet people in your field and hear how they're using Jupyter in their practices.  

We look forward to a great two days of talks and conversations, and look forward to seeing you there.
