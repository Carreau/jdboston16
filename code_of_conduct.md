# JupyterDay Code of Conduct for Organizers, Speakers, and Volunteers

Project Jupyter is an engaged and respectful community made up of people from all over the world. Your involvement helps us to further our mission and create an open platform that serves a broad range of communities, from research and education to journalism, industry and beyond.

At Project Jupyter and JupyterDay, we are committed to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Conference organizers will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any part of the conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Project Jupyter events.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive verbal comments related to race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical disability.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

By following the guidelines above and consistently and fairly resolving any complaints we can make attending JupyterDay a welcoming event.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Event organizers may take action to remedy or set right anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or any other conference participant feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report this as soon as possible. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone and we take them seriously.

## Anonymous Report

You can file an anonymous report here: http://goo.gl/forms/aQ8Wz4slfa

We can't follow up on an anonymous report with you directly, but we will take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

## Personal Report
You can make a personal report by:

*Phone*: Call or message.  A phone number will be provided that will be monitored for the duration of the event.

*In Person*: Contact a staff member, identified by STAFF badges

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. This can be uncomfortable, but we'll handle it respectfully and you can bring someone to support you.

*Email*: Send a message to projectjupyter@gmail.com

Our team will help you contact hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event.

## Enforcement Guidelines and Procedures

The goal of this document is to continually improve the community and create a safe and welcoming space for all. Ignoring our guidance or requests for compliance will have real consequences, such as being asked to leave the event, to ensure attendees feel they are protected. When taking action on any report, consider:

* The privacy and protection of the reporter are your first and foremost concern.
* Try to understand context and intent to get the whole picture, but note that  lack of intent to harm is not an excuse, and still requires redress to the injured party.
* For language-based issues, find out if the reported party is a native English speaker.  It is very easy for a non-native speaker to make an innocent mistake they aren’t even aware of, by transliteration or misuse of English words they don’t know well, know in a different context, or mis-translated from their original language.  Non-native speakers will often feel already uncomfortable in an English-only environment; approach them with the intention of explaining what the problem is.  A change of behavior may still be required, but a clarification of the language issue is more likely to produce benefit than purely punitive action. Stronger measures can still be taken if the person continues to engage in the behavior.

## Warnings

Event Managers/Lead Organizers can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the conference's anti-harassment policy. Make clear to the participant that if they ignore the warning their participation in the event may not longer be welcome (in other words they may be expelled).

Warnings should be reported to Ana Ruvalcaba via email ruv7.ana@gmail.com as soon as practical. The report should include:

* Identifying information (name/affiliation) of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The behavior that was in violation
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your full name
* Other people involved in the incident

## Presentations

Presentations, audience comments, or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although Event Managers/Lead Organizers should speak to the presenter/audience member afterward. However, Event Managers/Lead Organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation/audience comment/event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation/comment is not appropriate and cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.

Coach the speakers so that they are aware that they do not have to tolerate or respond to comments/questions which violates our code of conduct during their presentation.

## Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take.

Ask for information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s).

If the reporter requests additional support, you may assist them by asking for help from conference staff, a trusted person, contact a friend or contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the person submitting the report to take any action if they do not wish to do so. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with other staff or conference participants, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or responsible for resolving it.

## Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of the Lead Organizer/Event Manager for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

* A second offense resulting in an additional warning from Event Manager/Lead Organizer
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* A single serious offense (e.g., physical violence or groping someone)
* A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)

Hotel/venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

## Public statements

As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the conference.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.
