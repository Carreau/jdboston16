# Social Media

We will be using the hash tags `#JupyterDays` for the event. Please tweet liberally during the event!

# Structure and schedule

The first day consists of 30 minute talks, informal BoFs, and a panel on Jupyter in Education.  (Note that some speakers are are both speaking and on the panel.)  The second day is focused on longer, hands on tutorials and demos.

Since speakers may want to give demonstrations, you are free to use your own computer to present.  The room will have basic A/V and a projector that should fit most setups.  However, if you have a "weird system" (and, if you do, you're likely to know who you are!), please let me know and we can work with the A/V people to make sure it will work.

Please arrive at least 10 minutes before your talk.  An organizer will be on hand to help you get set up to present.

*If you have a link to your presentation and would like to add them to this page, please send me a pull request by Monday the 14, or send me a link and I will add it for you.*
